# MyTorch®

This repository is an implementation of a deep learning library written in NumPy. Inspired by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), this library, `MyTorch®` is used to create everything from multilayer perceptrons (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), to recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU) and long-short term memory (LSTM) structures.

`MyTorch®` is structurally similar to to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and its modules can be reused in other applications.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and run `poetry install`.
2. Run `make help` for further instructions.
